## 40-pin LS connector

### GPIO

RUBIK Pi 3 is compatible with WiringRP (based on the high-performance GPIO programming library WiringPi). It is recommended to use WiringRP for controlling and programming GPIOs. For more details about WiringRP, visit https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP.

#### Pinout

The figure below shows the default functions of the RUBIK Pi 3 40-pin LS connector, most of which are compatible with the default functions of the 40-pin connector of open-source development boards.

![](images/data-6.jpg)

The following table lists all functions of the 40-pin LS connector. Blue bold functions are default functions.

#### Control GPIOs using shell commands

Run the following commands on RUBIK Pi 3 to control GPIOs.

:::note

> The following commands require root privileges:
>
> * Run the `su root` command to switch to the root user:
>
>   * Username: `root`
>   * Password: `root`
> * Alternatively, under a regular user account, prepend `sudo` to the command, for example: `sudo gpio readall`, and enter the user's login password when prompted.
:::

* Using WiringRP commands:

  * View the GPIO status

    ```shell
    gpio readall
    ```

    ![](images/image-102.jpg)
  * Set the GPIO mode

    ```shell
    gpio mode 15 in             # Set pin 15 to input mode
    gpio pins                   # Check the mode
    gpio mode 15 out            # Set pin 15 to output mode
    gpio pins                   # Check the mode
    ```
  * Set the pin level

    ```shell
    gpio write 15 1             # Set pin 15 to high level
    gpio read 15                # Check the pin level
    gpio write 15 0             # Set pin 15 to low level
    gpio read 15                # Check the pin level
    ```
* Operate nodes under */sys/class/gpio*

  The table below shows the GPIO subsystem numbering.

  ![](images/image-265.jpg)

  * Go to the */sys/class/gpio* directory:

    ```shell
    cd /sys/class/gpio
    ```
  * Export the GPIO to be controlled. For example, pin 13 GPIO\_24:

    ```shell
    echo 559 > export
    ```
  * Go to the *gpio559* directory to set GPIO attributes:

    ```shell
    cd gpio559  
    ls
    ```

    ![](images/image-101.jpg)

The attributes are described as follows:

- direction:
  - Input: in
  - Output: out
- value:
  - Low level: 0
  - High level: 1
- edge (interrupt edge):
  - Rising edge trigger: rising
  - Falling edge trigger: falling
  - Both-edge trigger: both
  - Disabling interrupts: none

For example, set pin 13 to output a high level:

```shell
echo out > direction  
echo 1 > value
```

Cancel the export of pin 13 to user space:

```shell
echo 559 > unexport
```

#### Control GPIOs using WiringRP (C)

The WiringRP library provides a set of API functions that enable control with minimal logic.

* The following code snippet sets pin 13 as output, pin 15 as input, and loops to check the level status of pin 15.

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <wiringPi.h>

  int main (void)
  {
    wiringPiSetup () ;
    pinMode (13, OUTPUT) ;
    pinMode (15, INPUT) ;

    for (;;)
    {
      digitalWrite (13, HIGH) ;        // On
      printf("%d\n", digitalRead (15));        // On
      delay (1000) ;                // mS
      digitalWrite (13, LOW) ;        // Off
      printf("%d\n", digitalRead (15));        // On
      delay (1900) ;
    }

    return 0 ;
  }
  ```
* Compile programs:

  * Compile on RUBIK Pi 3

    ```shell
    adb push gpio.c /opt
    adb shell
    su
    cd /opt
    gcc gpio.c -o gpio -lwiringPi
    ```

  :::note

  > If the `gcc` command is not available, run `apt install gcc` to install the gcc compiler.
  :::
  >
* Short pin 13 and pin 15 with a Dupont wire, as shown in the following figure, to test the GPIO level control and read the level.

  :::warning

  > Pay attention to the pin order. Do not short the power and ground pins, as this may cause damage to the board.

### I2C

Inter-Integrated circuit (I2C) is a bidirectional 2-wire bus for an efficient inter‑IC control bus developed by Philips in the 1980s. Every device on the bus has its own unique address (registered with the I2C general body headed by Philips). The I2C core supports a multicontroller mode and 10‑bit target address and 10‑bit extendable address. For more information on I2C, see https://www.i2c-bus.org/fileadmin/ftp/i2c_bus_specification_1995.pdf.

RUBIK Pi 3 is compatible with WiringRP (based on the high-performance GPIO programming library WiringPi). It is recommended to use WiringRP for controlling and programming I2C. For more details about WiringRP, visit [https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP.](https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP)

### SPI

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data link that operates in full-duplex mode. SPI is also known as a 4-wire serial bus.

RUBIK Pi 3 is compatible with WiringRP (based on the high-performance GPIO programming library WiringPi). It is recommended to use WiringRP for controlling and programming SPI. For more details about WiringRP, visit [https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP.](https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP)

#### Pinout

The figure below shows the default functions of the RUBIK Pi 3 40-pin LS connector, most of which are compatible with the default functions of the 40-pin connector of open-source development boards.

![](images/data-6.jpg)

:::note

> Pins 19, 21, 23, and 24 are set to SPI by default.
:::

The following table lists all functions of the 40-pin LS connector. Blue bold functions are default functions.

## USB

RUBIK Pi 3 provides four USB ports:

* 2 x USB 3.0, host mode only (No.7 in the following figure)
* 1 x USB 2.0, host or device mode (No. 6 in the following figure)
* 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 1, host or device mode (ADB), Type-C with DisplayPort v1.4 (No. 5 in the following figure)

![](images/image-134.jpg)

### USB 2.0 Type-A

:::note

> The following commands require root privileges. Run the `su root` command to switch to the root user:
>
> * Username: root

> * Password: root
:::

The USB 2.0 port operates in host mode by default. In host mode, insert a USB flash drive, click the upper-left corner of the screen, then double-click the **Files** application at the bottom of the pop-up interface to open the file browser.

![](images/image-135.jpg)

In the file browser, click the USB drive listed on the left panel to display its contents. You can then perform operations such as copying and writing files to the USB drive.

![](images/image-132.jpg)

To switch the USB 2.0 port to device mode, you need to run commands manually. The following command is a switching method. Run the following commands in the RUBIK Pi 3 terminal to simulate RUBIK Pi 3 as a USB flash drive.

```shell
cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/ #Log in from the serial port or open the PC terminal and run the following commands
mkdir g1
cd g1
mkdir functions/mass_storage.0
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test.iso bs=1M count=2048 #Create a 2 GB USB drive space
mkfs.ext4 /tmp/test.iso
echo "/tmp/test.iso" > functions/mass_storage.0/lun.0/file
mkdir configs/c.1
ln -s functions/mass_storage.0/ configs/c.1/f3
mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/

echo device > /sys/kernel/debug/usb/8c00000.usb/qcom_usb2_0_mode #Switch USB to device mode
echo 8c00000.usb > UDC #Connect the USB cable. The USB drive is identified and can be written to and read from


echo host > /sys/kernel/debug/usb/8c00000.usb/qcom_usb2_0_mode #Remove the USB cable and switch to host mode
```

### USB 3.1 Type-C

The Type-C port can automatically switch between host and device modes.

* Automatically switches to device mode when connected to PC
* Automatically switches to host mode when an OTG cable is connected
* Automatically outputs DP video signals when connected to a DP monitor

### USB debugging

This section provides the methods for obtaining debug logs. The debug methods include `regdumps`, debug `ftraces`, and `configfs` nodes. When debugging issues related to entering or exiting low-power modes, system memory management unit (SMMU), and unclocked accesses, you can check the event and controller status details through the logs obtained by using the above methods.

#### USB tracing

Use `debugfs` to deeply trace each transaction over the USB line. To view the trace list, run the following command.

:::note

> Before running the command, ensure that `debugfs` has been mounted. If not mounted, run the following command to mount `debugfs`:&#x20;
>
> `mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug`
:::

```shell
ls /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/dwc3
```

The following traces can be used to verify data transmission in the xHCI, gadget stack, or USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI).

```shell
dwc3_alloc_request  dwc3_event              dwc3_gadget_generic_cmd  enable
dwc3_complete_trb   dwc3_free_request       dwc3_gadget_giveback     filter

  Log in to your RUBIK Pi 3 via ADB.

  ```shell
  adb shell
  su # Switch to the root user and enable command completion
  ```

  Run the following commands on RUBIK Pi 3 to record videos.

  ```bash
  export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib
  gst-launch-1.0 -e qtiqmmfsrc camera=0 name=camsrc video_0::type=preview ! video/x-raw\(memory:GBM\),format=NV12,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=30/1,compression=ubwc,interlace-mode=progressive,colorimetry=bt601 ! queue ! v4l2h264enc capture-io-mode=5 output-io-mode=5 ! queue ! h264parse ! mp4mux ! queue ! filesink location="/opt/mux0.mp4"
  ```

  The recorded video is saved a&#x73;*&#x20;/opt/mux0.mp4:*
* Taking photos

  Log in to your RUBIK Pi 3 via ADB.

  ```shell
  adb shell
  su # Switch to the root user and enable command completion
  ```

  Run the following commands on RUBIK Pi 3 to take photos.

  ```javascript
  export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib
  gst-launch-1.0 -e qtiqmmfsrc camera=0 name=qmmf ! image/jpeg,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=30/1 ! multifilesink location=/opt/frame%d.jpg sync=true async=false max-files=2
  ```

  The corresponding *frame%d.jpg&#x20;*&#x77;ill be generated in the */opt* directory.

### Troubleshoot camera issues

If the camera fails to display or capture images, check the following contents:

1. Check the camera module connection.

   For details, refer to [Connect the camera cable](#concam).
2. Run the single-stream preview test case.

   ```shell
   export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/dev/socket/weston
   export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1
   setprop persist.overlay.use_c2d_blit 2
   gst-launch-1.0 -e qtiqmmfsrc camera=0 name=camsrc ! video/x-raw\(memory:GBM\),format=NV12,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=30/1,compression=ubwc ! queue ! waylandsink sync=false x=1000 y=1000 width=960 height=540 enable-last-sample=false
   ```
3. Run the following command to collect logs.

   ```shell
   journalctl -f > /opt/log.txt
   ```

   Search for "probe success" in the logs. "probe success" indicates that the camera module is powered on and responding to I2C control. If the sensor does not have the "probe success" log, the possible cause is the flex cable connection or camera module issue.

   The following log indicates that an IMX477 is detected:

   ```shell
   [   80.645992] CAM_INFO: CAM-SENSOR: cam_sensor_driver_cmd: 939: Probe success,slot:7,slave_addr:0x34,sensor_id:0x477, is always on: 0
   ```
4. Check the camera sensor driver command.

   Collect logs using the `journalctl -f > /opt/log.txt` command and search for "cam\_sensor\_driver\_cmd" in the logs. "CAM\_START\_DEV Success" indicates that the camera sensor streaming started. "CAM\_STOP\_DEV Success" indicates that the camera sensor streaming has stopped. For example:

   ```shell
   start:
   [   81.172814] CAM_INFO: CAM-SENSOR: cam_sensor_driver_cmd: 1129: CAM_START_DEV Success, sensor_id:0x477,sensor_slave_addr:0x34
   stop:
   [   88.905241] CAM_INFO: CAM-SENSOR: cam_sensor_driver_cmd: 1157: CAM_STOP_DEV Success, sensor_id:0x477,sensor_slave_addr:0x34
   ```
5. Check the sensor streaming.

   Enable the CSID SOF/EOF IRQ logs, then execute the camera streaming command.

   ```shell
   mount -o rw,remount /usr
   mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/
   echo 0x8 > /sys/module/camera/parameters/debug_mdl
   echo 3 >/sys/kernel/debug/camera_ife/ife_csid_debug
   echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on
   echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/camera/cam_log_debug/enable
   echo 2 > /sys/module/camera/parameters/debug_type
   cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe > trace.txt
   ```

   The captured logs provide detailed information about the Start of Frame (SOF) and End of Frame (EOF). In the *trace.txt* log, search for "irq\_status\_ipp".

   * BIT12 (0x1000) represents the SOF packet.
   * BIT9 (0x200) represents the EOF packet.

   The log will appear as follows:

   ```shell
   <idle>-0       [000] d.h1. 19287.546764: cam_log_debug:
   CAM_DBG: CAM-ISP: cam_ife_csid_irq: 4996: irq_status_ipp = 0x1110 cam-server-25604     [000] dNH.. 19287.561705: cam_log_debug:
   CAM_DBG: CAM-ISP: cam_ife_csid_irq: 4996: irq_status_ipp = 0xee8
   ```

## HDMI OUT

The HDMI connector is component No.9 in the following figure.&#x20;

RUBIK Pi 3 HDMI specifications are as follows:

* HDMI 1.4
* 3840 x 2160@30 fps
* DSI 0 to HDMI (LT9611)
* Supports CEC
* Supports resolution auto-adjustment
* Supports hot swapping

![](images/image-151.jpg)

:::note

> DP and HDMI can be connected to a monitor simultaneously for concurrent display.
:::

### CEC

HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is a feature of HDMI designed to interconnect and control multiple connected devices via a single HDMI cable. CEC facilitates communication between connected devices through a dedicated CEC pin. For example, multiple devices can be controlled with a single remote control.

Run the following command to install cec-client.

```shell
sudo apt install cec-utils
```

After connecting the HDMI cable to a TV, run the following command to check whether the TV supports CEC.

```shell
echo 'scan' | cec-client -s -d 1
```

If the TV supports CEC, you will see the following output:

```plaintext

#### Obtain LT9611 logs

Run the following command to obtain LT9611 logs:

```bash
dmesg | grep lt9611
```

Check the logs. The following message indicates that HDMI OUT is functioning properly.

This log records the initialization of the LT9611 chip and the HDMI connection process, from firmware version detection to CEC initialization, indicating that the chip has started normally.

1. The firmware version of the chip is 0xe2.17.02. This indicates that during initialization, the driver successfully reads the version information.
2. The Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) function adapter of the LT9611 has been successfully registered.
3. CEC initialization is complete, which means that the CEC module of LT9611 is functioning properly.
4. The chip successfully reads the Hot Plug Detection (HPD) status, and a value is returned, confirming the connection of the HDMI device.
5. The chip detects the video signal parameters: horizontal resolution 1920 pixels, vertical resolution 1080 pixels, and pixel clock frequency 148500 kHz (148.5 MHz). This is a typical 1080p resolution (Full HD) with a 60 Hz refresh rate configuration.

## DisplayPort

RUBIK Pi 3 provides a USB Type-C that supports DisplayPort (DP) over Single-Stream Transport (SST), labeled as No. 5 in the following figure.

The DP specifications are as follows:

* 3840 × 2160@60 fps
* Single-stream transport
* Simultaneous operation of DP and USB 3.0

![](images/image-148.jpg)

:::note
DP and HDMI can be connected to a monitor simultaneously for concurrent display.
:::

### DP debugging

#### Obtain DP logs

:::note

> The following commands require root privileges. Run the `su root` command to switch to the root user:
>
> * Username: root
> * Password: root
:::

Run the following command to enable log printing.

```bash
echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk 
echo ‘file dsi* +p’ > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
```

:::note

> `8` in the first command is the log level. In the Linux kernel, log levels are represented by numbers from 0 to 8. The smaller the number, the higher the priority. The levels are described as follows:
>
> * 0 (KERN\_EMERG): System emergency (e.g., crash).
> * 1 (KERN\_ALERT): Issues that require immediate attention.
> * 2 (KERN\_CRIT): Critical errors.
> * 3 (KERN\_ERR): General errors.
> * 4 (KERN\_WARNING): Warnings.
> * 5 (KERN\_NOTICE): Normal events that are noteworthy.
> * 6 (KERN\_INFO): Informational messages.
> * 7 (KERN\_DEBUG): Debugging information.
> * 8: A level lower than debugging, displaying all levels of logs.
:::

Running the second command `echo ‘file dsi* +p’ > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control` will display the debug information from all kernel source files whose filenames start with *dsi\** (usually related to DSI display driver code). This debug information will be output to the kernel log, which can be viewed by running `dmesg`. The following command output can be used for DP debugging:

```bash
mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
echo 'file dp_display.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo 'file dp_aux.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo 'file dp_link.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo 'file dp_power.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo 'file dp_ctrl.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo 'file dp_parser.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
```

After printing all levels of logs, filter DP logs for further validation. The following output shows the logs for a successful DP startup.

The above logs for a successful DP startup are summarized as follows:

1. USB initialization: The system detects two single-port USB hubs during startup and disables the LPM of USB 5.
2. DP preparation: The DP controller is initialized, the display capabilities are read, and preparations are made to establish a connection.
3. DP link training: Multiple link training attempts are made to establish a stable connection between the DP and the display.
4. DP connection confirmation: The system confirms that DP-1 is connected and notifies the user space.
5. HDMI disconnection: LT9611 detects HDMI disconnection, which may be due to user action or interface switching.
6. DP output: After HDMI disconnection, DP enables video streaming and outputs 1080p@60 Hz video.

## Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

RUBIK Pi 3 is equipped with the AP6256 Wi-Fi module and supports Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.2.

### Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that uses the IEEE 802.11 protocol. It allows electronic devices like smartphones, wearables, laptops, desktops, and other consumer electronics to connect to the Internet without physical cables.

#### Operating bands

The AP6256 Wi-Fi chipset supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz operating bands.

#### Operating modes

The Wi-Fi software operates in the following modes.

| Mode          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| STA mode      | In STA mode, a device connects to an AP within a Wi-Fi network and communicates with other devices in the network. This mode is standard for wireless devices in a Wi-Fi connection. |
| Hotspot mode  | The hotspot mode enables a device to provide backhaul (Internet) connectivity to Wi-Fi clients using a cellular link (LTE). The device establishes this connection through its lightweight hotspot interface. In hotspot mode, the device can communicate with other Wi-Fi clients connected to the same hotspot, communicate with the hotspot device, and share the WAN connection of the device. |

##### STA mode

In Station (STA) mode, the device can be connected to an existing Wi-Fi network to access network resources or the Internet.&#x20;

**Using the user interface**

Connect your RUBIK Pi 3 to a monitor and click the icon in the top-right corner of the desktop. In the pop-up window, click the Wi-Fi icon and follow the prompts to connect to the appropriate Wi-Fi network. Once the connection is successful, a Wi-Fi icon will appear in the top-right corner, as shown below.

2. Connect to a Wi-Fi network.

   ```shell
   sudo nmcli dev wifi connect <WiFi-SSID> password <WiFi-password>
   ```

   For example, run the following command, where `WiFi-SSID` is `rubikpiwifi` and `WiFi-password` is `123456789`:

   ```shell
   sudo nmcli dev wifi connect rubikpiwifi password 123456789
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```shell
   Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with 'e8b98f24-3f23-4742-8aa3-0d37c5ee6564'.
   ```

   :::note

   > If you see a network error message when running the command, run one of the following commands to trigger a Wi-Fi scan and verify the target access point (AP).
   >
   > * `nmcli dev wifi list`
   > * `iw dev wlan0 scan`
   :::
   >
3. Check the network status.

   ```shell
   nmcli general status
   ```

   Sample output

   ```shell
   STATE  CONNECTIVITY  WIFI-HW  WIFI    WWAN-HW  WWAN
   connected  full     enabled  enabled  enabled  enabled
   ```
4. Verify the network status.

   1. Run the following command to check the device status.

      ```shell
      nmcli dev status
      ```

      Sample output

      ```shell

      wlan0   wifi      connected    RUbikpiWiFi
      eth0    ethernet  unavailable  --
      eth1    ethernet  unavailable  --
      can0    can       unmanaged    --
      lo      loopback  unmanaged    --
      ```
   2. Check the additional connection information.

      ```shell
      nmcli device show wlan0
      ```

      Sample output:

      ```yaml
      GENERAL.DEVICE:                         wlan0
      GENERAL.TYPE:                           wifi
      GENERAL.HWADDR:                         00:03:7F:12:F7:F7
      GENERAL.MTU:                            1500
      GENERAL.STATE:                          100 (connected)

##### Hotspot mode

In Access Point (AP) mode, namely, the wireless hotspot mode, the device becomes a gateway for other devices to connect to a network. The steps to create an AP are as follows:

* Enable the AP.

  1. Create or modify *hostapd.conf.*

     ```plain text
     ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
     driver=nl80211
     ieee80211n=1
     interface=wlan1
     hw_mode=a
     channel=36
     beacon_int=100
     dtim_period=1
     ssid=RUBIKPi
     auth_algs=1
     ap_isolate=0
     ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
     wpa=2
     wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
     rsn_pairwise=CCMP
     wpa_passphrase=123456789
     ```
  2. Run the following commands to enable the AP:

     ```shell
     hostapd -B /opt/hostapd.conf # Set the software AP
     # Enable the DHCP server
     brctl addbr br0
     brctl addif br0 wlan1
     ifconfig br0 192.168.225.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
     killall dnsmasq
     dnsmasq --conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.conf --dhcp-leasefile=/var/run/dnsmasq.leases --addn-hosts=/data/hosts --pid-file=/var/run/dnsmasq.pid -i br0 -I lo -z --dhcp-range=br0,192.168.225.20,192.168.225.60,255.255.255.0,43200 --dhcp-hostsfile=/data/dhcp_hosts --dhcp-option-force=6,192.168.225.1 --dhcp-script=/bin/dnsmasq_script.sh
     ```
  3. Run the following command to establish a connection with `hostapd_cli`.

     ```shell
     hostapd_cli -i wlan1 -p /var/run/hostapd
     ```

     Monitor Wi-Fi STA connection notifications in the `hostapd_cli` console, such as `AP-STA-CONNECTED` and `EAPOL-4WAY-HS-COMPLETED`.

     Sample output:

     ```shell
     root@rubikpi:~# hostapd_cli -i wlanl -p /var/run/hostapd
     hostapd_cli v2.11-devel
     Copyright (c) 2004-2022, Jouni Malinen <j@wl.fi> and contributors

     Interactive mode
     > <3>AP-STA-CONNECTED aa: a4: fd: 8b: ec: 90
     <3>EAPOL-4WAY-HS-COMPLETED aa: a4: fd: 8b:ec:90

     > list_sta
     aa: a4: fd: 8b:ec:90
     ```

  Before the AP 5G mode is enabled, if there has never been a connection to a 5G Wi-Fi network using STA, use the following command to check the 5G channel configuration in the environment:

  ```yaml
  iw dev wlan0 scan
  ```

  In the command output, identify the currently active channel through the **primary channel** field. In the following example, the value of **primary** **channel** is **36**. Write **36** into the **channel** field in the */opt/hostapd.conf* file.

  ```yaml
  HT operation:
                   * primary channel: 36
                   * secondary channel offset: above
                   * STA channel width: any
                   * RIFS: 0
                   * HT protection: nonmember
                   * non-GF present: 0
                   * OBSS non-GF present: 0
                   * dual beacon: 0
                   * dual CTS protection: 0
                   * STBC beacon: 0
                   * L-SIG TXOP Prot: 0
                   * PCO active: 0
                   * PCO phase: 0
  ```
* Verify AP

  To test the connection, connect to AP from other devices.

  For example, perform the following steps to connect to AP from a mobile device:

  1. On the mobile device, go to Wi-Fi settings.
  2. Wait for the Wi-Fi STA to detect AP.
  3. Select AP and type the corresponding `wpa_passphrase` configured for AP on your RUBIK Pi 3 device for connection.

## Ethernet

Ethernet technology is designed to transmit data over a channel using wired technology at different link speeds. It uses cables to transmit data in network models, such as Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) for a reliable, secure, and better network connectivity.

Ethernet connectivity is integrated into IoT devices and sensors, enabling them to transmit data to the network. It is defined under IEEE 802.3 standards and provides a standardized interface for these devices to communicate with gateways.

The Ethernet interface is port 8 in the following figure. RUBIK Pi 3 supports Gigabit Ethernet.

![](images/image-159.jpg)

Connect the network cable, as shown in the following figure:

![](images/20250314-155445.jpg)

Run the following command on RUBIK Pi 3 to check the network connection. As shown in the following figure, the IP address has been successfully assigned, indicating that the network connection is successful:

![](images/image-158.jpg)

### Ethernet debugging

Use the following types of logs to record and debug Ethernet-related issues.

* `dmesg`: Debug issues related to kernel drivers.
* `tcpdump`: Verify packet transmission.

To debug potential issues that may occur during Ethernet setup, perform the following steps:

1. To collect `dmesg` logs and debug issues related to the kernel driver, run the following command:

   ```shell
   dmesg > /var/log/dmesg_logs.txt
   ```
2. To collect `tcpdump` logs and verify packet transmission, run the following command:

   ```shell
   tcpdump -i any -s 0 -w /var/log/tcpdump.pcap
   ```
3. Collect the output from the ethtool, ifconfig, netstat, and IP routing table for debugging.

## RTC battery connector

The real-time clock (RTC) battery connector is port 1 in the following figure.

![](images/image-157.jpg)

Connect the RTC battery as shown in the following figure and write the time into the system hardware clock of RUBIK Pi 3. This way, the system time of RUBIK Pi 3 can be saved even if it is completely powered off.

![](images/20250314-155435.jpg)

Write the system time to the system hardware clock on RUBIK Pi 3 as follows:

```shell
date -s "08:00:00 20241201" # Set system time to 08:00, December 1, 2024
hwclock -w # Write system time to system hardware clock
```

## M.2 Key M connector

RUBIK Pi 3 provides an M.2 slot for NVMe storage, which can be used to install a 2280 (22 x 80mm) SSD hard drive. The M.2 Key M slot supports PCIe Gen3 x 2 and can deliver an output of up to 3.3V 2A. The switch of the M.2 connector can be individually controlled.

The M.2 Key M connector uses the PCIe1 bus of the QCS6490. The device path is: */sys/bus/pci/devices/0001:00:00.0*.&#x20;

The M.2 Key M connector is connector 18 in the following figure:

### PCIe power management

PCIe defines two types of power management methods:

* Software power management, which determines the power management features for each device and manages them individually.
* Systems that do not require software intervention, such as Active State Power Management (ASPM).

When no data packets are being transmitted on the PCIe link, the device puts the PCIe link into a low-power state.

#### PCIe L0 link states

PCIe power management defines the following L0 link states:

* L0: working state
* L0s: ASPM state with low-resume latency (energy saving standby state)&#x20;

#### PCIe device states

PCIe power management defines the following device states:

* D0 (mandatory): The device is fully ON. There are two sub-states.

  * D0(uninitialized): The function is in D0 (uninitialized) state when waiting for enumeration and configuration after exiting the reset state.
  * D0(active)

    * The function enters the D0(active) state once the enumeration and configuration process is completed.
    * The function enters the D0(active) state when the system software enables one or more (in any combination) function parameters, such as memory space enable, I/O space enable, or BME bits.
* D1 (optional): light sleep state

  * The function can only initiate the PME message and cannot initiate other TLPs.
  * The function can only serve as the target for configuration transactions, not for other transactions.
  * The function enters the D1 state via a software command that sets the PM control and status registers.
* D2 (optional): deep sleep state

  * The function can only issue PME messages and cannot issue other TLPs.
  * The function can only serve as the target for configuration transactions, not for other transactions.
  * The function enters the D2 state via software commands that set the PM control and status registers.
* D3 (mandatory): The device is in the lowest power state, and this function must support two types of D3 states:
* D3(hot)

  * The function can only issue PME messages and cannot issue other TLPs.
  * The function can only serve as the target for configuration transactions, not for other transactions.
  * The function enters D3(hot) state by issuing a software command that sets the power state field.
* D3(cold): The device enters the D3(cold) state and is powered off. When power is restored, the device enters the D0(uninitialized) state.

### PCIe debugging

The M.2 Key M connector uses the PCIe1 bus of the QCS6490. The device path is: */sys/bus/pci/devices/0001:00:00.0*.&#x20;

The `lspci` and `setpci` commands are native to Linux distributions. These two commands provide multiple levels of output and can also be used to view the capabilities and states of different components trained on the PCI bus at a given time. Most of these capabilities reflect the configuration space registers required by the PCIe basic specification. For more detailed information, visit https://pcisig.com/specifications. To view the usage instructions, run the following command:

```shell
lspci --help
```

The following features help in debugging PCIe issues:

* Display device information.

  ```shell
  lspci
  ```
  Sample output:

  ```shell
