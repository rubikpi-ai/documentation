# Explore Sample Applications 

This section outlines a modular, hands-on approach to AI development using Qualcomm®-supported tools, runtimes, and frameworks.  
Whether you're training models, deploying pre-trained networks, or building multimodal AI workflows, this guide offers a modular, hands-on approach.  

The document covers:  
* Model creation with **Edge Impulse** and **Qualcomm® AI Hub**  
* Inference using **LiteRT, TensorFlow Lite, and ONNX Runtime**  
* Local execution of large language models with **Llama.cpp**  
* Workflow orchestration with **Genie**  
* Sample applications using **IMSDK** and robotics SDKs 

Each section is designed to be standalone, so you can jump directly into the tools and flows that match your project needs. The goal is to provide clear, reusable examples and practical insights for integrating AI into real-world edge applications.
