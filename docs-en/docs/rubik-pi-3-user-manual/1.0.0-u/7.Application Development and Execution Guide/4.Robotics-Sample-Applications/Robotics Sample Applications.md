The Qualcomm® Intelligent Robotics (QIR) SDK for Ubuntu provides essential components for developing robotic features on Qualcomm platforms using the Ubuntu operating system.

## Key Features of the QIR SDK:  
•	**Reference ROS Packages**: Includes Robot Operating System (ROS) packages to support robotic application development.  
•	**End-to-End Scenario Samples**: Offers sample scenarios to help evaluate robotic platforms.  
•	**QRB ROS Transport**: Enables zero-copy transport of ROS messages on Qualcomm robotics platforms.  

:::note
 QRB ROS Transport is implemented based on [REP 2007](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2007.html), which defines interfaces for serializing custom types and supports intra-process communication without conversion.

**Prerequisites**   
* **Ubuntu OS** should be flashed  
* **Terminal access** with appropriate permissions    
* Run **install_ppa_pkgs.sh** script to install necessary packages 
	```shell
	git clone -b ubuntu_setup --single-branch https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/rubikpi-script.git 
	cd rubikpi-script  
	./install_ppa_pkgs.sh 
	```

## Getting Started with QIR SDK on Ubuntu
This guide walks you through using QIR sample applications on development kits running Ubuntu.

## Setup Instructions:
1.	Fetch ROS2 and QIR SDK using scripts.
2.	Install the QIR SDK.
3.	Add ROS source to your device following the ROS2 documentation.
4.	Add Qualcomm public PPA archives to your Ubuntu software sources: 

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-qcom-iot/qcom-ppa
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-qcom-iot/qirp
```

5.	Install and configure the QIR SDK: 
```shell
sudo apt install qirp-sdk
source /usr/share/qirp-setup.sh
```

## Sample Applications
The QIR SDK includes a variety of sample applications categorized as follows:  
•	**Platform Sample Applications**: Demonstrate platform-level capabilities.  
•	**Robotics Sample Applications**: Enable robotic functionalities such as CPU load monitoring and robot simulation using ROS2.  


## Simulation Sample – AMR Simple Motion  
The **AMR simple motion** is a simulated sample application that uses a Python-based ROS node to control the movements of QRB autonomous moving robots (AMRs) within the simulator.  

The [qrb-ros-simulation](https://github.com/qualcomm-qrb-ros/qrb_ros_simulation) package provides a simulation environment. It allows you to control the movement of QRB AMRs through publishing the ROS messages to the /qrb_robot_base/cmd_vel topic.
