# Fan

For the fan compatible with RUBIK Pi 3, refer to [Peripheral Compatibility List](https://www.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/peripheral-compatibility-list).

:::warning

When using RUBIK Pi 3 in high-load or high-performance scenarios, use cooling measures to ensure stable performance of the device. Otherwise, performance may fluctuate due to high CPU temperatures.
:::

## Install the fan

1. Paste the two thermal pads to the corresponding positions on RUBIK Pi 3.

  :::warning
  
  We recommend that you do not remove the fan after installing it on your RUBIK Pi 3. Removal will cause the fan's push pins and thermal pads to degrade and may result in product damage. If the push pins are damaged, deformed, or not clipping securely, stop using the fan.

## Control the fan

The fan of RUBIK Pi 3 controls the speed according to the CPU temperature. You can also run the following commands on RUBIK Pi 3 to control the fan speed. 0 and 255 indicate the minimum and maximum speed of the fan, respectively.

```shell
echo 100 >  /sys/devices/platform/pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon*/pwm1
echo 255 >  /sys/devices/platform/pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon*/pwm1
echo 0 >  /sys/devices/platform/pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon*/pwm1
```

:::note
Before setting the fan speed to a fixed value, disable CPU thermal management using the `systemctl stop rubikpi-thermal` command.
