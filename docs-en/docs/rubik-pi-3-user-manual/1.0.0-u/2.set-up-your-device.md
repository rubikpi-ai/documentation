# Setup your device

This chapter offers a streamlined guide for developers to set up the **RUBIK Pi 3** development board across **Ubuntu**, **Windows¬Æ**, and **macOS¬Æ** environments. Whether you're powering on the device for the first time, configuring the debug UART for serial access, or establishing network and SSH connections, this section ensures a smooth and reliable onboarding experience.  
It also covers essential procedures such as entering **EDL mode** for firmware flashing and verifying your **Ubuntu 24.04** installation‚Äîlaying the foundation for AI, multimedia, and embedded development workflows.  

### üèÅ Let‚Äôs Get Started!

<a id="poweron"></a>
## Power on the device

 Connect a 12V, 3A Type-C power adapter.  
 :::warning
RUBIK Pi 3 supports Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 power input. **A Type-C 12V 3A power adapter compliant with PD 3.0 is recommended for input power**.
The power indicator LED near the power port will turn on if the power adapter meets requirements and power negotiation succeeds. If the adapter does not meet requirements, the LED will remain off and the device will not boot.
:::
:::note
Plug in a USB Type-C to USB Type-A or a Type-C cable to establish connection for flashing operation.  
:::

Board versions v02 and later support automatic power-on after the power adapter is connected. You can check the hardware version number at the following location on the board. In the example below, the hardware version is V02.

:::note
If the blue LED on the board is constantly lit, it indicates that the power button was pressed for too long, and the board is in fastboot mode. Please refer to [**FAQ**](./11.Troubleshooting/4.troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-exit-fastboot-mode-on-the-rubik-pi-3) to exit the fastboot mode.

## Connect to the network

Use one of the following methods to establish an internet connection and obtain the device's IP address.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="WiFi" label="Connect using Wi-Fi">

The device is running in Station mode for Wi-Fi. When the device boots up, it initializes the Wi-Fi host driver and performs network management authentication. Users can establish a wireless connection using the nmcli command-line tool.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the following command to connect to the wireless access point (Wi-Fi router):

   ```shell
   sudo nmcli dev wifi connect <WiFi-SSID> password <WiFi-password>
   ```

    Example

    ```
    sudo nmcli dev wifi connect RUBIKPiWiFi password 1234567890
    ```
    ```
    Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with 'd7b990bd-3b77-4b13-b239-b706553abaf8'.
    ```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the following command to verify the connection and device status:

      ```shell
      sudo nmcli -p device
      ```

    ![](./images/image-7.jpg)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the following command to verify the WLAN connection status and IP address.

    ```shell
    ip addr
     ```

     ![](./images/image-8.jpg)

4Ô∏è‚É£ To ensure the connection is active, perform a ping operation to a website such as that of RUBIK Pi:

     ```shell
    ping rubikpi.ai
     ```
 </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="ETH" label="Connect using Ethernet">

1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port (RJ45) on your RUBIK Pi 3, and the other end to the network router.

![](./images/image-5.jpg)

2Ô∏è‚É£ After establishing the connection, run the following command on the UART serial console to obtain the IP address:

    ```shell
    ip addr
    ```

    ![](./images/image-6.jpg)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Establish SSH connection  

Secure Shell (SSH) is used for secure file transfer between the host and RUBIK Pi 3.

Before connecting to SSH, ensure that the network connection is established.

1Ô∏è‚É£ To find the IP address based on the network connection type, run the following command in the UART console:

   ```shell
   ip addr
   ```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the following command from the host to establish an SSH connection with the device. Use the IP address obtained in step 1.

   ```shell
   ssh <user name>@ip-address
   ```

    Example:
    ```
    ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.222
    ```

3Ô∏è‚É£ To connect to SSH, enter the user's password when prompted.

:::note
Ensure that the host is connected to the same network as the device.
