# Ubuntu Desktop Vs Server  

**Ubuntu Desktop requires the open-source Freedreno graphics driver rather than the proprietary Qualcomm Adreno driver**. While the Adreno driver supports hardware-accelerated pre- and post-processing, it is not compatible with the standard Ubuntu Desktop environment. Freedreno ensures broader compatibility with desktop features and graphical applications in Ubuntu 24.04.
:::note
Ubuntu Server can still be used as a **SBC** (Single Board Computer) without host requirements.

Ubuntu Desktop and Server are the two primary versions of the Ubuntu operating system, each tailored for distinct usage scenarios and requirements. The following are the main differences between them:

| Dimension         |  Desktop Version                   |  Server Version                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Design goal     | Interactive experience, multitasking                    | Service stability, resource efficiency                      |
| User interface     | Graphical (GNOME)                         | Wayland Display                             |
| Memory usage     | Relatively high (GUI resident)                         | Relatively low                                  |
| Qualcomm AI support | Supports non-graphical AI                     | Supported                   |
| GPU driver     | Uses freedreno                          | Uses adreno                           |
| CSI camera   | Supported                                    | Supported                           |
