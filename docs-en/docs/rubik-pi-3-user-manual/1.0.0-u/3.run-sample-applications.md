## Run AI sample applications

AI sample applications perform use cases for object detection and parallel inferencing on camera, video file, or Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) input streams on the RUBIK Pi 3 device. The procedure involves downloading the models from [Qualcomm® AI Hub](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/iot/models) and labels from GitHub, transferring them to RUBIK Pi 3, and running the sample applications.

![](./images/image-15.jpg)

**Prerequisites**

The device requires models and label files to run the AI sample applications.

<a id="proced"></a>
**Procedure**

Before running the application, make sure the [Weston display is enabled](#prerequisites-for-running-sample-applications). To launch the application, run the following use case from the SSH terminal:

1. Install the camera-related software.

   1. Add the RUBIK Pi PPA to Ubuntu sources and update the package list:

       ```shell
       sudo sed -i '$a deb http://apt.rubikpi.ai ppa main' /etc/apt/sources.list
       sudo apt update
       ```

   2. Install the camera software.

       ```shell
       sudo apt install -y qcom-ib2c qcom-camera-server qcom-camx
       sudo apt install -y rubikpi3-cameras
       sudo chmod -R 755 /opt
       sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/camera/
       sudo touch /var/cache/camera/camxoverridesettings.txt
       sudo sh -c 'echo enableNCSService=FALSE >> /var/cache/camera/camxoverridesettings.txt'
       ```

2. You need the following models for the AI sample applications:

    | Sample Application         | Required Model                          | Required label file          |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
    | AI object detection        | yolov8_det_quantized.tflite             | yolonas.labels               |
    | Parallel AI inference      | yolov8_det_quantized.tflite             | yolov8.labels                |
    | Parallel AI inference      | inception_v3_quantized.tflite           | classification.labels        |
    | Parallel AI inference      | hrnet_pose_quantized.tflite             | hrnet_pose.labels            |
    | Parallel AI inference      | deeplabv3_plus_mobilenet_quantized.tflite | deeplabv3_resnet50.labels    |

3. Download and run the automated script to get the model and label files on the device:

    ```shell
    curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quic/sample-apps-for-qualcomm-linux/refs/heads/main/download_artifacts.sh
    ```

    ```shell
    chmod +x download_artifacts.sh
    ```

    ```shell
    ./download_artifacts.sh -v GA1.4-rel -c QCS6490
    ```

:::note

 The YOLOv8 models are not part of the script. You need to export these models using the Qualcomm AI Hub APIs.
:::

4. Export YOLOv8 from Qualcomm AI Hub.

    Follow these validated instructions to export models on your host computer using Ubuntu 22.04. You can also run these instructions on Windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or set up an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine on macOS. For more details, see Virtual Machine Setup Guide.

       1. Obtain the shell script for exporting the models:
    
          ```shell
          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quic/sample-apps-for-qualcomm-linux/refs/heads/main/scripts/export_model.sh
          ```

       2. Update the script permissions to make it executable:
    
          ```shell
          chmod +x export_model.sh
          ```

       3. Run the export script with your Qualcomm AI Hub API token as the value for the --api-token argument:
   
          ```shell
          ./export_model.sh --api-token=<Your AI Hub API Token>
          ```

       :::note
       You can find your Qualcomm AI Hub API token in your [account settings](https://app.aihub.qualcomm.com/account/).
       :::
   
       4. The script downloads the models to the `build` directory. Copy these models to the */etc/models/* directory of your device using the following commands:
   
          ```shell
          scp <working directory>/build/yolonas_quantized/yolonas_quantized.tflite ubuntu@<IP address of target device>:/etc/models/
          ```

          ```shell
          scp <working directory>/build/yolov8_det_quantized/yolov8_det_quantized.tflite ubuntu@<IP address of target device>:/etc/models/
          ```
   

5. Update the `q_offset` and `q_scale` constants of the quantized LiteRT model in the JSON file. For instructions, refer to Get the model constants.

6. Use the following command to push the downloaded model files to the device:

    ```shell
    scp <model filename> ubuntu@<IP addr of the target device>:/etc/models
    ```

scp inception_v3_quantized.tflite ubuntu@<IP addr of the target device>:/etc/models/
scp yolonas.labels ubuntu@<IP addr of the target device>:/etc/labels/
```

7. Create a directory for test videos using the following commands:

    ```shell
    ssh ubuntu@<ip-addr of the target device>
    ```

    ```shell
    mount -o remount, rw /usr
    ```

    ```shell
    mkdir /etc/media/
    ```

8. From the host computer, push the test video files to the device:
 
    ```shell
    scp <filename>.mp4 ubuntu@<IP address of target device>:/etc/media/
    ```
