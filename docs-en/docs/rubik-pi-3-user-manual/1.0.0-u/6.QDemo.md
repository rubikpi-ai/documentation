# Qualcomm® Qdemo

The Qualcomm® Qdemo application provides a graphical interface to explore multimedia and AI sample applications powered by the Qualcomm Intelligent Multimedia Product (QIMP) SDK. Designed for developers working on Ubuntu-based Dragonwing boards, Qdemo enables rapid evaluation of AI pipelines and multimedia capabilities without writing GStreamer code manually.  These applications demonstrate real-time performance by leveraging GPU and NPU acceleration, thanks to QIMP’s zero-copy architecture.  The QIMP SDK handles tasks like video capture, resizing, cropping, inference, and rendering—all orchestrated through GStreamer plugins such as:  

`qtivtransform`: Accelerates color conversion, cropping, and resizing on GPU.  
`qtimltflite`: Executes TensorFlow Lite models on NPU.  

This setup allows developers to focus on evaluating performance and capabilities, rather than low-level implementation.  

## Getting Started with Qdemo  
To begin exploring Qdemo on the target device, follow these step-by-step instructions to install required dependencies, configure the system, and launch the graphical interface.  

#### 1️⃣ Before launching the Qdemo, ensure the target device meets all the following prerequisites  
•	**Ubuntu OS flashed** and terminal access became available.  
•	**SBC mode enabled** with mouse, keyboard, HDMI monitor, and cable connected.  
•	If you haven’t previously installed the PPA packages, please run the following steps to install them.  
	```shell
	git clone -b ubuntu_setup --single-branch https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/rubikpi-script.git 
	cd rubikpi-script  
	./install_ppa_pkgs.sh 
	```
•	Connect the **CSI camera**  
•	Connect USB camera (Optional) 

#### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies      
Open the terminal from SBC and install following packages.  
```shell
sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gtk3
sudo apt-get install python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

#### 3️⃣ Create media, labels, models and data folder and change owner to ubuntu:ubuntu.   
```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/media
sudo mkdir -p /etc/labels
sudo mkdir -p /etc/models
sudo mkdir -p /etc/data
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /etc/media/
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /etc/labels/
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /etc/models/
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /etc/data/
wget -P /etc/media/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quic/sample-apps-for-qualcomm-linux/refs/heads/main/scripts/download_artifacts.sh
wget -P /etc/media/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quic/sample-apps-for-qualcomm-linux/refs/heads/main/artifacts/qdemo/Qdemo.gif
wget -P /etc/media/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quic/sample-apps-for-qualcomm-linux/refs/heads/main/artifacts/qdemo/Qdemo.png  
```
#### 4️⃣ Launch the GUI    
gst-gui-launcher-app.py
