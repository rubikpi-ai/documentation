### Electrical characteristics

#### Power supply requirements

RUBIK Pi 3 supports Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 power input. A Type-C 12V 3A power adapter compliant with PD 3.0 is recommended for input power.

The power indicator LED (in yellow green) will turn on if the power adapter meets requirements and power negotiation succeeds. If the adapter does not meet requirements, the LED will remain off and the device will not boot.

![](images/40-pin.jpg)


The following table list the pin definition of the 40-pin LS connector:

![](images/image-94.jpg)

  Functions bolded in blue are default functions.

RUBIK Pi 3 provides 28 GPIOs. By default, 2 x I2C, 1 x UART, 1 x SPI, 1 x I2S, 1 x PWM IO, and 9 GPIOs are configured.

The level of all GPIOs is 3.3V. The I2C GPIOs (GPIO 4, 5, 12, 13) are in open-drain output mode with 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistors. The other GPIOs are in push-pull output mode, and the external pull-up or pull-down resistors of the connected signals cannot be less than 50 kΩ due to the limitations of the on-board level shifter IC.

The GPIOs belonging to the same QUP group can be flexibly configured as UART or SPI. For details, refer to the user manual.

The 2.54mm pitch 40-pin LS connector is compatible with the expansion boards of most open-source development boards.


### HDMI connector

RUBIK Pi 3 comes with a standard-sized HDMI connector that is compatible with HDMI 1.4. This connector supports a maximum output of 4K 30 Hz. Additionally, it provides the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) functionality, as well as 5V DDC and HPD interfaces.
