# C/C++ Prebuilt Sample Applications

The Qualcomm Intelligent Multimedia SDK (IM SDK) includes a set of prebuilt sample applications designed to help developers quickly evaluate multimedia and AI capabilities on Qualcomm® hardware. These applications are built using GStreamer pipelines and IM SDK plugins, and serve as reference implementations for common use cases such as camera capture, video playback, object detection, pose estimation, and more.  

## Why Use Prebuilt Sample Apps?  
Prebuilt sample apps provide a fast and reliable way to:  

**Validate hardware functionality**: Confirm that camera, display, audio, and AI accelerators are working correctly on your development board.  
**Understand pipeline structure**: Learn how GStreamer pipelines are constructed using IM SDK plugins like `qtivtransform`, `qtimltflite`, and `qtivcomposer`.  
**Benchmark performance**: Measure throughput and latency for real-time multimedia and AI tasks using optimized pipelines.  
**Accelerate development**: Use working examples as a starting point for building custom applications. Each sample demonstrates best practices for zero-copy data flow, hardware offload, and plugin configuration.    

## When to Use Them  
Use the prebuilt sample apps when:  

* You’re setting up a new development board and want to verify system readiness.  
* You need a reference implementation for a specific use case (e.g., YOLOv8 object detection, PoseNet inference).  
* You’re debugging pipeline behavior and want to isolate plugin performance.  
* You’re exploring IM SDK capabilities and want to experiment with different pipeline configurations before writing custom code.  

These apps are especially useful during early development and prototyping phases, and can be extended or modified to suit your specific application needs.  

## Pre-requisites  
On Target  

    Ubuntu OS should be flashed  
    Terminal access with appropriate permissions    
    Run install_ppa_pkgs.sh script to install necessary packages  

:::tip
Make sure your system meets all the prerequisites before launching the sample apps.
:::

1: Download and run the artifact script  
This script will automatically fetch all required components for running the sample applications, including:  
    * Models  
    * Labels  
    * Media files  

**Script Details**
You can run the following commands on SSH terminal/SBC terminal.
```shell
cd /home/ubuntu 
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quic/sample-apps-for-qualcomm-linux/refs/heads/main/download_artifacts.sh
sudo chmod +x download_artifacts.sh 
sudo ./download_artifacts.sh -v GA1.5-rel -c QCS6490
```
**Explanation**  
* Use the `-v` flag to define the version you want to work with (e.g., GA1.5-rel).
* Use the `-c` flag to define the chipset your device is using.(e.g., QCS6490).

2: Verify Model/Label/Media Files  
Before launching any sample applications, make sure the required files are in place.    

Check the following directories:    
    **Model files** → `/etc/models/`  
    **Label files** → `/etc/labels/`   
    **Media files** → `/etc/media/`  

:::note
 These files are essential for AI and multimedia apps to function correctly. If they’re missing, re-run the artifact download script.

3: Sample Application    
**Input Source – Media File; Output Source - Waylandsink**  
**Model Precision - Quant model; Runtime - TFLite; Script used - JSON**  

For Multimedia sample applications, please make sure the camera is connected (pre-requsities)

Use the SSH/SBC terminal to launch your sample application.  
:::note
Note: In case if the terminal is in root, the we need to set the following environment. Otherwise for ubuntu user, it is not required. export `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u ubuntu)`
:::

Example
```shell
gst-ai-classification
```
To display the available help options, run the following command in the SSH shell:  
```shell
gst-ai-classification -h
```

**To stop the use case, use CTRL + C**
