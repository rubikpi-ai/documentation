# Reset to Factory Ubuntu Image

This guide outlines a simplified recovery process for devices that are misconfigured, corrupted, or require a fresh start—restoring the original Canonical Ubuntu image to ensure a reliable starting point for development.   
 :::warning
    Updating the software with the prebuilt images erases all data on your device and installs a newer image. Ensure you back up important data before you start.
