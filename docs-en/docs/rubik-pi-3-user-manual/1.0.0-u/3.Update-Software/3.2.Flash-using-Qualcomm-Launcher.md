	:::tip Qualcomm Launcher Fails to Start or Crashes
	- Confirm that you downloaded the correct version for your OS and architecture.  
	- If you still see the issue follow the [**Manual Flash**](../11.Troubleshooting/11.1.flash-over-android.md) 
	:::

	**IDE Method**: 
	You can create AI and multimedia applications on the Qualcomm Dragonwing‚Ñ¢ RB3 Gen 2 Development Kit using the Qualcomm¬Æ Visual Studio Code Extension. It‚Äôs an integrated application development environment for Qualcomm development kits. The extension runs in Ubuntu (or WSL with Ubuntu) and facilitates device configuration, software development including compilation, debugging, and binary flashing.
	
	For more information, see the [**Qualcomm Visual Studio Code Extension Reference Guide**](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-79972-1/quick_start.html).
