# 40-pin LS connector

## GPIO

RUBIK Pi 3 is compatible with WiringRP (based on the high-performance GPIO programming library WiringPi). It is recommended to use WiringRP for controlling and programming General-Purpose Inputs/Outputs (GPIOs). For more details about WiringRP, visit https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP.

### Pinout

The figure below shows the default functions of the RUBIK Pi 3 40-pin LS connector, most of which are compatible with the default functions of the 40-pin connector of open-source development boards.

The following table lists all the functions of the 40-pin LS connector, where the default ones are bolded in blue.

### Use GPIOs

On RUBIK Pi 3, you can use shell commands or programming languages to control the General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO).

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="GPIO Shell" label="Shell command">
    Perform the following steps on your RUBIK Pi 3 to control GPIOs.
    
    :::note
    The following commands require the root privilege:

    * Use the `sudo -i` command to switch to the root user.

    * For regular users, run commands with the `sudo` prefix, such as `sudo gpio readall` and enter the user's login password as prompted.
    :::

    * Using WiringRP commands:

         Before using the WiringRP commands, install the WiringRP as follows:

   1. Add the RUBIK Pi public personal package archive (PPA) to your RUBIK Pi 3 Ubuntu software sources. 
       
        ```shell
        sudo sed -i '$a deb http://apt.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/noble ppa main' /etc/apt/sources.list
        sudo apt update
        ```
   2. Run the following command to install WiringRP.
        
        ```shell
        sudo apt install wiringrp
        ```

         Use the following commands to operate GPIOs after installation：

    * View the GPIO status

        ```shell
        gpio readall
        ```

         ![](../images/image-98.jpg)

   *  Set the GPIO mode

        ```shell
        gpio mode 15 in             # Set pin 15 to input mode
        gpio pins                   # Check the mode
        gpio mode 15 out            # Set pin 15 to output mode
        gpio pins                   # Check the mode
        ```

    *  Set the pin level

        ```shell
        gpio write 15 1             # Set pin 15 to high level
        gpio read 15                # Check the pin level
        gpio write 15 0             # Set pin 15 to low level
        gpio read 15                # Check the pin level
        ```

    * Operate nodes under */sys/class/gpio*:
  
         The table below shows the GPIO subsystem numbering.

        ![](../images/20250603-170502-en.jpg)

        1. Go to the */sys/class/gpio* directory:

             ```
             cd /sys/class/gpio
             ```

        2. Export the GPIO to be controlled. For example, pin 13 GPIO_24:
             ```
             echo 571 > export
             ```

        3. Go to the gpio571 directory to set GPIO attributes:

             ```
             cd gpio571
             ls
             ```
             ![](../images/20250603-174456.jpg)

        - direction:
            - input: in
            - output: out
  
        - value:
            - Low level: 0
            - High level: 1
  
        - edge (interrupt edge):
            - Rising edge trigger: rising
            - Falling edge trigger: falling
            - Both-edge trigger: both
            - Disabling interrupts: none

        4. For example, set pin 13 to output a high level:

        ```
        echo out > direction
        echo 1 > value
        ```
        5. Cancel the export of pin 13 to user space:

        ```
        echo 571 > unexport
        ```

## I2C

Inter-Integrated circuit (I2C) is a bidirectional 2-wire bus for an efficient inter‑IC control bus developed by Philips in the 1980s. Every device on the bus has its own unique address (registered with the I2C general body headed by Philips). The I2C core supports multicontroller mode, 10‑bit target addressing, and 10‑bit extendable addressing. For more information on I2C, see https://www.i2c-bus.org/fileadmin/ftp/i2c_bus_specification_1995.pdf.


RUBIK Pi 3 is compatible with WiringRP (based on the high-performance GPIO programming library WiringPi). It is recommended to use WiringRP for controlling and programming I2C. For more details about WiringRP, visit https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/WiringRP.

Pin 3 and pin 5 are set to I2C1 by default.

              ```

            * Write 0xaa to register 0x01 of the device whose address is 0x38:

              ```shell
              i2cset -f -y 1 0x38 0x01 0xaa
              ```

            * Read the value at register 0x01 of the device whose address is 0x38:

              ```shell
              i2cget -f -y 1 0x38 0x01
              ```

        The WiringRP-Python library provides a set of API functions that enable control with minimal logic.

        To install WiringRP-Python on your RUBIK Pi 3, follow these steps：

        1. Add the RUBIK Pi public personal package archive (PPA) to your RUBIK Pi 3 Ubuntu software sources.
        ```shell
        sudo sed -i '$a deb http://apt.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/noble ppa main' /etc/apt/sources.list
        sudo apt update
        ```
        2. Run the following command to install WiringRP-Python.
        ```shell
        sudo apt install wiringrp-python
        ```
        The following code snippet uses UART to send and receive data.
        ```python

        with serial.Serial(
