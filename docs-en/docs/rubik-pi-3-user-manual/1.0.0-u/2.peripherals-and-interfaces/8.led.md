# LED

RUBIK Pi 3 features an RGB tri-color LED driven by the Power Management IC (PMIC). By default, the green LED is set as a heartbeat indicator to reflect the system's operation status and CPU load. 

LED indicator descriptions:
- Blue LED (solid on): fastboot mode
- Green LED (heartbeat blinking): normal operation
- Red LED (heartbeat blinking): low-power mode (power input is less than 12V 2.25A).
- Rapid heartbeat: high CPU load
- No heartbeat:
  - System crash
  - Sleep mode
  - Booting up

Use the following commands to operate the LED:

* Turn off the heartbeat LED

  ```shell
  echo none > /sys/class/leds/green/trigger
  ```

* Turn on the heartbeat LED

  ```shell
  echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/green/trigger
  ```

* Set the brightness of the green LED (from 0 to 511. The following example sets it to 100)

  ```shell
  echo 100 >  /sys/class/leds/green/brightness
  ```

* Set the brightness of the red LED (from 0 to 511. The following example sets it to 100)

  ```shell
  echo 100 >  /sys/class/leds/red/brightness
  ```

* Set the brightness of the blue LED (from 0 to 511. The following example sets it to 100)

  ```shell
  echo 100 >  /sys/class/leds/blue/brightness
  ```
