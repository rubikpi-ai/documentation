### Use the cross-compilation tools

After setting up the cross-compilation environment by using the `source environment-setup-armv8-2a-qcom-linux` command as described in the previous section, use the following method to cross-compile the executable program of RUBIK Pi 3.

#### Build the project using Makefile

The header file path *sysroot* must be set for cross-compilation. Use the `--sysroot=dir` parameter to specify the path.

```shell
aarch64-qcom-linux-gcc --sysroot=/home/zhy/rubikpi/sdk/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux
```

:::note

 In the above command, the cross-compilation toolchain is installed at the */home/zhy/rubikpi/sdk* directory of the PC. Change the directory to your actual installation directory.
:::
#### Build the project using CMake

The following is an example of using *aarch64.cmake&#x20;*&#x74;o set the compilation toolchain:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm64) #Set the target processor architecture

#Set sysroot
set(TOOLCHAIN_DIR /home/zhy/rubikpi/sdk/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSROOT ${TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux)

#Set the cross-compiler
SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/sysroots/x86_64-qcomsdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-qcom-linux/aarch64-qcom-linux-gcc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/sysroots/x86_64-qcomsdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-qcom-linux/aarch64-qcom-linux-g++)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

When using CMake to build a project, create a *CMakeLists.txt* according to the actual situation of the project and run the following command to generate the Makefile.

```shell
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=aarch64.cmake
```

## Set up the Windows 11 development environment

Use WSL to set up an Ubuntu VM on Windows 11.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a Windows feature that allows you to run Linux distributions on Windows, without using virtualization software. Setting up WSL on Windows 11 involves the following tasks:

![](images/image-82.jpg)

:::note

 You can only compile the Qualcomm Linux build using WSL. To flash the software on RUBIK Pi 3, see [1.3.3.1 Flashing images on a Windows system](./1.get-started.md#flashwin).
:::

### Requirements on the host machine

Before setting up an Ubuntu VM using WSL, ensure that your Windows 11 host machine meets the following system requirements:
| Specification         | Requirement               |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Processor architecture | x86 or Arm®              |
| CPU cores            | 8 or more                 |
| RAM                  | 8 GB or larger            |
| Storage              | 300 GB available space    |
| Operating System     | Windows 11                |

### Prerequisites to set up WSL

To set up WSL, you must turn on specific Windows features and set the default WSL version.

* Windows Subsystem for Linux

* Virtual Machine Platform

To turn on these features, run the following commands in Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges:

* Windows Subsystem for Linux

```sql
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

* Virtual Machine Platform

```sql
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform
```

 :::note
 Restart the Windows 11 host machine after running the commands.
 :::


### Set the default WSL version

To set Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 as the default Linux distribution, run the following command in Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges:

```sql
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

The output is as follows:

```sql
For information on key differences with WSL 2 please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2. The operation completed successfully.
```

### Install the Ubuntu-22.04 Linux distribution

Qualcomm Linux uses the Ubuntu-22.04 Linux distribution. Before installing Ubuntu-22.04, verify if it is available as one of the valid distributions for installation on your Windows 11 host machine.

1. To list the distributions available for installation, run the following command in Windows PowerShell:

```sql
wsl --list --online
```

2. Verify that Ubuntu-22.04 is listed as one of the distributions.

    ![](images/image-80.jpg)

:::note

 If you do not see Ubuntu-22.04 in the distributions listed, contact Microsoft support.
 :::

3. To update WSL, run the following command:

```sql
wsl --update
```

4. To install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, run the following command:

```sql
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

5. After the installation is complete, set the username and password for the Ubuntu-22.04 Linux distribution you installed.

### Create the .wslconfig file for WSL

Use the *.wslconfig* file to configure settings, such as memory, processors, and swap storage space for Linux distributions running on WSL. The *.wslconfig* file does not exist by default. Hence, you must create one in the *%UserProfile%* directory.

To create the *.wslconfig* file, perform the following steps:

1. In Windows PowerShell, run the `cd ~` command to go to the *%UserProfile%* directory. For example, the directory path can be *C:\Users\\\<UserName>.*

2. Create a file named *.wslconfig* with the following contents:

```shell
    # Settings apply across all Linux distributions running on WSL 2
    [wsl2]
    # Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
    memory=64GB
    # Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
    processors=16
    # Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
    swap=64GB
    # Sets swapfile path location, default is %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp\swap.vhdx
    swapfile=C:\\temp\\wsl-swap.vhdx
    # Enable experimental features
    [experimental]
    # Automatically releases cached memory after detecting idle CPU usage. Set to gradual for slow release, and dropcache for instant release of cached memory.
    autoMemoryReclaim=dropcache
```

:::note

 Set the values for memory, processors, and swap size to match with the specifications of your Windows host machine.
 :::

3. To shut down WSL, run the following command in Windows PowerShell:

```shell
wsl --shutdown
```

3. To restart WSL, run the following command in Windows PowerShell:

```shell
wsl
```

### Set up the WSL environment

To configure DNS settings for WSL, use th&#x65;*&#x20;resolv.conf* file.

To configure local settings for the Ubuntu-22.04 Linux distribution you installed, use the *wsl.conf* file. The settings in the *wsl.conf* file are automatically applied every time you run WSL.

### Configure DNS settings for WSL (resolv.conf file)

In a Linux terminal window, use the `sudo` command to add the following contents in the */etc/resolv.conf* file:

```shell
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf'
```
When you close the Linux terminal window, the nameserver reverts to its default nameserver automatically. To save the changes you made to the *resolv.conf* file permanently, run the following command:
```
sudo chattr -f +i /etc/resolv.conf
```
To change the write permissions and modify the *resolv.conf* file, run the following command:
```
sudo chattr -f -i /etc/resolv.conf
```
### Configure local settings for Ubuntu-22.04 (wsl.conf file)

In the Linux terminal window, use the `sudo` command to add the following contents in the */etc/wsl.conf* file:

```shell
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
[automount]
options = "metadata"
[boot]
command = service docker start
```

In Windows PowerShell, run the following command to restart WSL:

```shell
wsl --shutdown
```

### Enable long path support for Git

To enable long path support for Git, run the following command in the Linux terminal window:

```shell
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

### Optional: Change the Ubuntu installation drive

By default, Ubuntu is installed on the C drive. If the C drive on your Windows host machine does not have enough disk space for builds, you can move the Ubuntu installation to another drive.

To move the Ubuntu installation to another drive, perform the following steps:

1. Open **Add or Remove Programs** an&#x64;**&#x20;**&#x66;ind the Ubuntu installation in the list.

2. In the **Control Panel**, choose **Programs** > **Programs and Features**.

3. Right-click the Ubuntu installation for which you want to change the drive, and select **Uninstall** or **Uninstall/Change**.

&#x20;    The following dialog box appears.

![](images/image-81.jpg)

4. Click **Move**.

5. Select the drive that you want to move the Ubuntu installation to, and click **Move**.

#### Device tree

The top-level device tree of RUBIK Pi 3 is *rubikpi3.dts*, which is located in the *arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom* directory. It is recommended that all modifications to the device tree be made in this file.

In addition, during the development process, the *sc7280.dtsi* in the same level of directory may be frequently checked. *sc7280.dtsi* has nodes commonly used during the development process, including GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, CPU, and GPU.

On the Qualcomm platform, drivers and device trees related to display, graphics, camera, video, and other components are separated from the main Linux kernel source and maintained in independent repositories. Follow the [Yocto Project User Guide](./10.yocto-project-user-guide.md#chap10) to download the Yocto project source code. You can then navigate to the *layers/meta-qcom-hwe* directory, where the *.bb* files provide information about the specific code repositories.

For example, to view the device tree configuration for the camera, check the *layers/meta-qcom-hwe/recipes-multimedia/cameradlkm/cameradlkm_1.0.bb&#x20;*&#x66;ile. The content is as follows:

```shell
SRCPROJECT = "git://git.codelinaro.org/clo/le/platform/vendor/opensource/camera-kernel.git;protocol=https"
SRCBRANCH  = "camera-kernel.qclinux.1.0.r1-rel"
SRCREV     = "0f2b11fac7f13f76a9e9f8e25ae2de5c97b23169"
```

* The repository address is: https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/le/platform/vendor/opensource/camera-kernel.git

* The branch is `camera-kernel.qclinux.1.0.r1-rel`

* The commit is `0f2b11fac7f13f76a9e9f8e25ae2de5c97b23169`

To ensure that the board works correctly after the compiled device tree is flashed to it, RUBIK Pi 3 stores these device tree repositories independent of the Linux kernel source in the directory *arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom.*

* Display: *arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/display-devicetree*

* Camera: *arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/camera-devicetree*

* Graphics: *arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/*&#x67;raphics-devicetree

* Video: *arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/video-devicetree*

When using the `./rubikpi_build.sh -d` command to compile the device tree, it will first compile the kernel device tree *rubikpi3.dtb* as the base device tree. Then, it will overlay the device trees from the sub-repositories onto the base device tree, and finally, it will overlay the *arch/arm64/boot/dts/thundercomm/rubikpi3/rubikpi3-overlay.dtso* device tree. It is recommended to incorporate any modifications to the sub-repository device trees into the *rubikpi3-overlay.dtso*.

### Compile code

1. Run the following command to set up the cross-compilation environment. For details, refer to [Install cross-compilation tools](./1.get-started.md#Installcross-compilationtools).

   ```shell
   source <your toolchains directory>/environment-setup-armv8-2a-qcom-linux
   ```

    :::note
    The cross-compilation environment is only effective on the current terminal.
    :::

   If the following error occurs, input the `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH` command and run the above command again.

   ![](images/image-115.jpg)

2. Go to the kernel directory and compile the kernel.

   ```shell
   ./rubikpi_build.sh -a
   ```

    :::note
   
    * The first compilation takes a longer time based on different computer configurations. In most cases, it takes less than 20 minutes. Subsequent compilations are only performed on modified code.
   
    * The kernel directory can be cleaned up using the `./rubikpi_build.sh -c` command, after which all compilation artifacts and some configuration content will be deleted.
    :::
3. Go to the kernel directory. Package the kernel and device tree image.
<a id="linuxkernelpack"></a>

   ```shell
   ./rubikpi_build.sh -dp -ip
   ```

   ![](images/image-105.jpg)

   If the following error occurs when you package the image:

   ![](images/image-107.jpg)

   Run the following command to modify the *.mtoolsrc* file, add `mtools_skip_check=1`, and try packaging the image again.

   ```shell
   vim ~/.mtoolsrc
   ```

   :::note
   
    During the update in March 2025, if non-official images of RUBIK Pi 3 are flashed, copy *efi.bin&#x20;*&#x69;n the corresponding image package to the *rubikpi/tools/pack&#x20;*&#x64;irectory before packaging.
    :::
    
   :::note
   
    Running the `./rubikpi_build.sh` command completes step 2 and step 3.
    :::
4. Go to the kernel directory and flash the kernel and device tree image.

   ```shell
   ./rubikpi_flash.sh -d -i -r
   ```

    :::note
   
    Before flashing, ensure that RUBIK Pi 3 has entered fastboot mode. Use one of the following methods to enter fastboot mode:
    - In the RUBIK Pi 3 terminal, input `reboot bootloader`. When RUBIK Pi 3 enters fastboot mode, the blue indicator lights up.
    - Press and hold the **[PWR]** button until the blue indicator lights up.
    :::
5. For details about how to use the `./rubikpi_build.sh` and `./rubikpi_flash.sh` scripts, use the `–h` parameter.

Run the `./rubikpi_buils.sh -h` command to view how to use the build script.

Sample output

```shell
Usage:
  bash ./rubikpi_build.sh [options]

Options:
  -h, --help              display this help message
  -dp, --dtb_package      generate a burnable device tree image
  -ip, --image_package    generate a burnable kernel image
  -a, --build_all         Complete compilation of kernel
  -d, --build_dts         Complete compilation of device tree
  -gc, --generate_config  Generate. config file
  -c, --clean             Clean up workspace

```

Run the `./rubikpi_flash.sh -h`  command to view how to use the flashing script.

Sample output

```shell
Usage:
  bash ./rubikpi_flash.sh [options]

Options:
  -h, --help     display this help message
  -r, --reboot   exit fastboot mode
  -d, --dtb      flash device tree image
  -i, --image    flash kernel image
```

### Compile the ko driver module separately

1. Create a Makefile as follows. Change `KDIR` to the actual kernel source code directory.

   ```makefile
   obj-m += hello.o  
   KDIR:=/home/rubikpi/kernel-6.6
   PWD?=$(shell pwd)
   all:
           make -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) modules
           echo $(PWD)
   clean:
           rm -f *.ko *.o *.mod *.mod.o *.mod.c *.symvers *.order
   ```

2. Create a *hello.c* file as follows:

   ```c
   #include <linux/module.h>
   #include <linux/init.h>

   static int hello_init(void)
   {
       printk("hello RUBIK Pi!\n");
       return 0;
   }

   static void hello_exit(void)
   {
       printk("bye RUBIK Pi!\n");
   }

   module_init(hello_init);
   module_exit(hello_exit);

   MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
   MODULE_VERSION("V1.0");
   MODULE_AUTHOR("RUBIK Pi");
   ```

3. Run the following commands to compile the ko module:

   ```bash
   export ARCH=arm64  
   export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-qcom-linux-  
   make
   ```

4. Transfer hello.ko to your RUBIK Pi 3 using the ADB or SCP method.

5. Run the following commands on your RUBIK Pi 3 to verify that the compilation artifact is valid.

   ```shell
   insmod hello.ko
   rmmod hello.ko
   dmesg | grep "RUBIK Pi"
   ```

    ![](images/image-104.jpg)

### Configure the kernel

Run the following commands to configure the Linux kernel using `menuconfig`:

```bash
cd linux  
make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig
```

After the configuration is completed, run the following commands to save the configuration.

```shell
make ARCH=arm64 savedefconfig  
cp defconfig ./arch/arm64/configs/rubik_pi3_defconfig
```
